# Akash Chandiramouli's First CS193 Homework

- CS193 is a really interesting and useful course which I believe will be really useful for succeeding in Comp Sci.
- Github is a widely used tool and getting comfortable with it is extremely useful.
- A free website domain is always good and can be used as a portfolio for work and more.
